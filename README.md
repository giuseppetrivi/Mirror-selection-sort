# mirror-selection-sort
This is my optimized version of Selection Sort.

The code is written in C and compiled for test with clang-7

There is how it works:

  <i>Array = 8 9 3 6 3 8 1 6 4
  Find the minimum and max
  Switch min and max with first and last element
  Array = "1" 4 3 6 3 8 8 6 "9"

  Then the same, but starting from 4 to 6
  Array = 1 "3" 4 6 3 6 8 "8" 9

  Then
  Array = 1 3 "3" 6 4 6 "8" 8 9

  Then
  Array = 1 3 3 "4" 6 "6" 8 8 9
  The array is ordered</i>

<b>Enjoy :)</b>
